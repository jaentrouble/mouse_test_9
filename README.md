 DDQN

## Purpose

1. Try Double DQN and Dueling DQN. See if they help.

## Lessons from last experiment

1. Even with the exact same condition, results may vary.

2. Always think of falling into local minima.

## TODO in this experiment

1. Implement Double DQN

2. Implement Dueling DQN

## Plan

1. Try Double DQN first.

2. Add Dueling DQN to see if it makes any difference.

## Other changes

1. Changed some code so that the Player class is more generally usable.

2. Now both CartPoleTest and SanityCheck uses the same Player class from Agent.

## Tests

## Discussion

## TODO
